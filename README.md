# MSTWithKruskalAlgorithm

## About this program

Our program is basically divided into two parts:
* Initially, it reads a file named "**EdgesFile.txt**", where there is a description of a graph:
  * The **first line** indicates the **number of vertices**;
  * The **second** one indicates the **number of edges**;
  * All the lines above, except the last one, indicates, respectively, the **origin vertex**, the **destination vertex** and the **edge weight**. Each one is separeted by a space;
  * The last line is a "**\n**" char.
* After reading the file, it generates a new graph with an **Adjacent Matrix** representation;
* After that, using the generated graph, a new **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is generated using the **Kruskal Algorithm**.
<br>

* The **second part** consists of a set of performance testes;
  *  Basically, there are generated a previously defined quantity of **random graphs**. These graphs also have their **number of vertices** and **number of edges** previously defined. The **weight** is a randommically value generated;
  *  After generating the graphs, their **MSTs** are also generated;
  *  The application ends showing the **elapsed time** of each realized test.

## How to use

* First, we will need to inform a valid information about a graph in the file. 
* In this example, we used the graph below, with 7 vertex and 11 edges.
  * So the first line of the file will have the file 7, the second value 11 and the other lines will have the information of the vertices and the weight of the edge between them.
  * The quantity of lines with information of the vertices and weight must be the same value of edges of the graph that was informed in the second line.

* The second part cosists of a series of performance tests, where we increase the number of vertices or edges in different situations. In the end we show the average elapsed time to execute each test in each situation.
  * The graphs in these tests have the number of vertices and the number of edges previously definited as is shown above;
  * The vertices with edges and the weight of each edge is a randomly generated value.

## Results

* Executing the program with the previous file, the respective list of edges was returned to us after running the algorithm:
  *   0 - 3: 5.0;
  *   2 - 4: 5.0;
  *   3 - 5: 6.0;
  *   0 - 1: 7.0;
  *   1 - 4: 7.0;
  *   4 - 6: 9.0.
* With this list of edges, we can build the following MST:

* Finishing the execution of our application, we obtained the following average elapsed times:
